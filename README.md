# The impact of sex on the immune system explored at the single-cell level

Sex has a major role in determining susceptibility and progression of disease, ranging from communicable diseases (such as viral infections) to autoimmune disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis). The immune system differs between the sexes, and differences are generated through genes and their interactions along with external factors such as age and life events. Here, we characterize differences in immune cells across the sexes at single-cell resolution to help better dissect these factors. Using 1.25 million immune cells from 982 individuals, we assessed cell-type proportions, sex-biased gene expression, co-expression networks, and sex-biased expression quantitative loci (eQTLs). We show that sex-biased gene expression can be obscured by cell-type composition, with novel differential expression explained by improving cell-type resolution. Further to this, we identify that regulatory sex-differences are cell-type specific, potentially linked to higher immune-related activity in females. Our work highlights sexually dimorphic genes and pathways at baseline that could be targeted in immune therapies. â€ƒ
